    <h1>Monster Cookies<h1>
    <h3><em>By Nigella Lawson</em></h3>
    <img src="cookiepic.jpg" alt="Cookies with little yellow, brown, and orange candies mixed in.">
    <p> Studded with <a href= "https://www.mms.com/en-us/">colored candies</a> (delicious if they are peanut-filled,too) these treats are an amazing way to end a <a href= "https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/dinner-vs-supper-difference-history-meaning">grown-up supper,</a> and a very useful way to keep a roomful pf boisterous children happy. </p>

    <h3> Ingredients:</h3>

  <ul>
      <li>1 cup flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>9 tablespoons butter, at room temperature</li>
      <li>½ cup light brown sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup superfine sugar</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>¾ cup chopped pecans</li>
      <li>1 cup M&M's or other sugar-coated candies like Reese's pieces</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Step One</h3>

<p>Heat oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl combine flour, baking powder, salt and rolled oats. Set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer combine butter, light brown sugar and superfine sugar. Beat until creamy. Add egg and vanilla, and beat again until smooth.</p>

<h3>Step Two</h3>

<p>Add flour mixture to butter mixture, and beat until smooth. By hand, fold in chopped pecans and M&M's.</p>


<h3>Step Three</h3>

<p>Roll quarter-cup measures of dough into balls and flatten them into fat disks (about ½ inch thick). Place on a parchment-lined or greased baking sheet, about 6 at a time, so they have room to spread.</p>

<h3>Step Four</h3>

<p>Bake until cookies are risen, dry on surface and very lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. They will be too soft to lift from baking sheet. Set aside to harden for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool.</p>
